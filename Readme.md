# Non work domains

This is a list of domains that are not work related.

We use this list to block non-professional domains from creating new accounts for [June](https://june.so).

## How to use this list

You can use this list to block non-professional domains from creating new accounts for your B2B SaaS product.

This is helpful for both reducing the amount of spam accounts on your platform and making it easier for your sales team to understand if a lead is a good fit for your product.

## How to contribute

If you have a domain that you think should be added to this list, please open a PR adding it to the `data/domains.txt` file.

If you have a domain that you think should be removed from this list, please open a PR removing it from the `data/domains.txt` file.
